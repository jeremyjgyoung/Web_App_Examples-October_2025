## Explore the Examples

### 1. Set up the examples with your Database

- Go to src/pocketbase.js
  - Replace the team# with your team number. For instance, if you are on team 2 you the url should read: export const dbUrl = `https://oct2025-team2.pockethost.io/`;

### 2. Sign Up with a Test Account

- You can use any email & password to sign up.

### 3. Open the Examples

- Use the navigation bar to navigate to different pages.
- Read the relevant files in src/pages/ to how to build out your application.

## The Application Setup

### Routing & Navigation Bar

- The src/App.jsx file is where you add to the navigation bar and where you define where the navigation bar leads to.

### Pages

- The src/pages/ folder holds the code for the different pages.

### Components

- Components for the navigation bar are in the src/components folder.
- Feel free to take a look and modify these components.
- Or break up your application by adding more components in the components folder.
- Most components are from Flowbite React.

### Hooks

- CRUD operations are Foundation middleware written in src/hooks/database.js
